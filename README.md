# Decision Stump by Hand

This repository contains an implementation of a **Decision Stump**, a simple **one-level decision tree classifier**, applied to the **Electron Shower dataset**.

## Overview
- A **Decision Stump** is a tree classifier with **only one depth**, meaning it splits data based on a single feature.
- This implementation **trains a stump from scratch** without relying on built-in tree models.
